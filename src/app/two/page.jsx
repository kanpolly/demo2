                    <h1>Greece</h1>
                    <p><strong>Welcome tsomefhekvgevhilo Athens</strong></p>
                    <p>Athens is the capital and largest city of Greece. A major coastal urban area in the Mediterranean, Athens is
                        also the capital of the Attica region and is the southernmost capital on the European mainland. With its urban
                        area's population numbering over three and a quarter million, it is the eighth largest urban area in the
                        European Union. The Municipality of Athens (also City of Athens), which constitutes a small administrative unit
                        of the entire urban area, had a population of 643,452 (2021) within its official limits, and a land area of
                        38.96 km2 (15.04 sq mi). </p>
                    <p>The Athens Marathon takes place in November every year and is recognized as the original marathon course. In
                        1896 the organizing committee who revived the modern Olympics, were inspired by the bravery of the Athenians at
                        the Battle of Marathon in 490 B.C., as well as the legend of the messenger who ran from the town of Marathon to
                        Athens with the news of victory. The Athens Marathon starts near the battle field area at Marathon and finishes
                        in the magnificent all marble Panathenaic Stadium that was built for the first modern Olympics of 1896, it is a
                        short distance from the Acropolis. You will be running in the footsteps of the ancient heroes and legends who
                        gave birth to western civilization. </p>
